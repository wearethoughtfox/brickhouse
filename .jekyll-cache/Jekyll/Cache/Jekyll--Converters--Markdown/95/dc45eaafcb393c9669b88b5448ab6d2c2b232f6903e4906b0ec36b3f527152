<h2 id="removal-of-surface-dirt">Removal of surface dirt</h2>
<p><img src="/images/dirt-under-stretcherC1-300x400.jpg" alt="dirt-under-stretcher" /></p>

<p>Time and environment can cause layers ofÂ dirtÂ to build up on theÂ surface of a painting. Removal of dirt such asÂ smoke,Â fingerprints and nicotineÂ may assist with revealingÂ the colours, fine detail or brushwork the artist originally intended to be seen.</p>

<p>Dirt found on the reverse of paintings may be detrimental to the painted layers on the front. It readily absorbs moisture and particles may become trapped between stretcher and canvas creating undesired surface undulations. The addition of a backing following treatment prevents the accumulation of dirt building up in the future.</p>

<h2 id="remove-discoloured-varnish-layers">Remove discoloured varnish layers</h2>
<p>Traditionally, paintings were varnished with a natural resin varnish to saturate colours and protect the surface. However these are prone to darkening and turning yellow over time through the varying effects of light, heat and environment. This disguises the artistsâ€™ original colours and intentions. They may beÂ carefullyÂ removed by a conservator. LINK CHIDDINGFOLD They are replaced with synthetic resins whichÂ have beenÂ formulated and tested by conservation scientists to minimise future degradation.</p>

<h2 id="repair-torn-and-damaged-paintings">Repair torn and damaged paintings</h2>

<p><img src="/images/tear-repair-C-580x404.jpg" alt="tear-repair" /></p>

<p>The studio offersÂ various techniques, materials and adhesivesÂ to sympathetically mend tears. This tear is being repaired by re-weaving linen threads and restoring the canvas tension as close to its pre-torn condition as possible. This intricate process is carriedÂ out under magnification using tweezers and a fine paintbrush to apply the adhesive.</p>

<h2 id="lining">Lining</h2>
<p>Lining imparts strength to the original canvas. Less invasive, and preventativeÂ treatments are also available such as strip and dry lining.</p>

<h2 id="historic-labels">Historic labels</h2>
<p>Canvas stamps or lables on the reverse may aid dating a painting and provide information on its historical provenance. The longevity of historic labels can be prolonged by careful treatment and protective measures.</p>

<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>
<p>A wideÂ range of natural, traditional and modern syntheticÂ materials are available to enable each painting and problem to be treated on an individual basis.</p>
