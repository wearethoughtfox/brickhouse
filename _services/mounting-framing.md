The Brick House offers a bespoke mounting and framing service to both conservation and museum standards for all types of artwork and memorabilia.

We pride ourselves on offering superior quality, a great eye for detail, colour and design and aim to supply each and every client with a finished product which will exceed their expectations.  We make sure to source the best materials that conform to the Fine Art Trade Guild standards for conservation and museum level framing in order to not only enhance the contents but to protect and preserve it for the future.
