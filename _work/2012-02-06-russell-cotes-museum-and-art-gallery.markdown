Excited to be part of the successful application process for a Woodmansterne Conservation Grant to have this beautiful painting finally conserved. ‘Weaving the Garland’ by Henry Thomas Schafer, 1879 belongs to the fascinating collection at [Russell Cotes Museum & Art Gallery.](http://www.russell-cotes.bournemouth.gov.uk/default.asp)

[Look out for the treatment taking place in installments in the eye of the public, early 2013. ](http://www.woodmansterne.co.uk/ScholarandCons.html)
